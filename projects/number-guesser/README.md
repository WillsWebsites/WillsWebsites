## Instructions
### Guess a number between 1-20. You will then find out if your guess is too high or too low from the wording on the right. Each time you guess incorrectly your score will decrease. Once you guess the correct number your score will be kept and you can try again to beat it. Maybe if you're lucky you can get it first try?
