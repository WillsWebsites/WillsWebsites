# One-N'-Done
## A 2-player game to see who can get to 100 points first. But be careful, if you roll a 1 then any points you haven't held will be lost!

## Instructions
### The goal is to be the first player to 100 points. You accumulate points by rolling the dice and then 'holding' those points. However if you roll a '1', then whatever points you haven't held will be lost and it will switch to the other player's turn. Don't get too greedy!
